# WorkoutTracker
Android Basics Nanodegree Project 8

### Goal of the app
This app was the 8th project in my Android Basics Nanodegree program at <a href="http://udacity.com">udacity.com</a>. The app is a classical workout tracker: it provides you the opportunity to track your workout sessions with time and intensity values (calories are static, they are counted from the intensity and the time). You have the possibility not only to add and delete but also to edit your workouts data.

Used technologies:
- SQLite database CRUD methods
- Alerts with actions
- Custom menu items
- Custom home button navigation
